      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = 'Lux'; //changes players as well, since team is a copy of players

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person; //any changes made to captain will also be changed in person; this is reference only

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: '@wesbos',
          facebook: 'wesbos.developer',
        },
      };

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
      dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'; //this changes wes as well, because it was only one level deep

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
